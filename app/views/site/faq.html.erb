  <li><b>What is SeamConnect?</b></br>
  <p>SeamConnect is a NAT and firewall traversal infrastructure service. The service provides geographically distributed STUN and TURN servers which aid in NAT and firewall traversal for IP based real time applications such as WebRTC.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>As a WebRTC service/app/platform provider, why should I use the SeamConnect?</b></br>
  <p>SeamConnect service provides automatically updated, standards compliant and global infrastructure for NAT and firewall traversal. As a WebRTC service/platform provider, you can continue to invest your time and energy on your core product/business, instead of worrying about the NAT traversal issues at the client end. Instead of managing infrastructure and dealing with NAT/firewall traversal quirks, you can focus on your product and features that provide differentiation. You need not have dedicated personnel working to making sure that your NAT traversal servers are up and running providing the best network experience. To add, it also works out cheaper than running your own geographically distributed servers.</p>
